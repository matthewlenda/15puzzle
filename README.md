**15 Puzzle** is a classic sliding puzzle game where players arrange tiles in numerical order by sliding them into an empty space. The game is traditionally played on a 4x4 grid, but this version allows customization with 3x3 and 5x5 grid options. You can also choose to play with numbers or use custom images for a unique visual challenge.

## Key Features
- **Multiple Grid Sizes**: Play on 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 grids to adjust the difficulty level.
- **Image and Number Options**: Choose between a traditional numbered puzzle or customize with images.
- **Move Counter**: Track the number of moves taken to solve the puzzle.
- **Shuffle and Reset Options**: Start with a randomized configuration and reset as needed.
- **Responsive UI**: Simple and intuitive controls for smooth gameplay.

## How to Play
1. **Select Grid Size and Tile Style**: Choose between 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 grids and whether to use numbers or an image.
2. **Slide Tiles**: Click on a tile adjacent to the empty space to slide it into the space.
3. **Arrange Tiles in Order**: For numbered puzzles, arrange the tiles in numerical order from top-left to bottom-right, with the empty space in the bottom-right corner. For image puzzles, reassemble the image by sliding pieces into place.
4. **Challenge Yourself**: Try to solve the puzzle in the fewest moves possible!
